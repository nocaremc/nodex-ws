NoDex-WS will be a Node.js + Websockets library for the bitshares dex allowing developers who do not want to use python to jump into writing trading applications.
Disclaimer: Nobody has taught me node or websockets. Should be fun ugly but that is why we iterate.

While I do want to learn, I'm writing this on fumes. R&D on my end will be limited to just getting things to a functional state.

# Things I want in this library

- authenticate with any account
- list the balances of accounts
- send money to other accounts
- obtain a list of all assets
- obtain a list of all asset pairs
- check the ticker price of any asset pair
- check the buys and sells of any asset pair
- check the buys and sells of accounts
- manage buys and sells for any asset pair

# wishlist (and maybe not belonging in this library)

- check the state of margins for accounts
- manage margins for accounts
- a hookable/actionable event system for all actions (eg. monitoring margins and taking action)
- use the first public working or configured (and working) dex rpc node.
